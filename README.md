# codes-i-like
This is just where i save a copy of the codes i came across on the internet. 

These are NOT coded by me. 
I am not the right person to allow or prohibit you to use the codes. 

I've mentioned the links of where i got the code from on the hyperlink above. I dont know how to credit the original devs otherwise. 
All of these codes should be opensource as per the best of my knowledge. 

With all my love,
- KK
